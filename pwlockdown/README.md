## Security Best Practices

1. **Production Deployment**:
   - Use a separate encryption key from SECRET_KEY
   - Enable HTTPS/SSL
   - Configure proper session security
   - Set up regular backups

2. **User Education**:
   - Encourage strong master passwords
   - Promote 2FA usage
   - Regular security checkups

3. **Monitoring**:
   - Monitor security logs regularly
   - Set up alerts for suspicious activity
   - Regular password strength audits

## Development

### Adding New Features
1. Create new models in `models.py`
2. Add serializers in `serializers.py`
3. Create API views in `views.py`
4. Add URL patterns in `urls.py`
