# Use the template survey
python manage.py seed_balanced_honesty

# Or create manually through admin interface
```

### 3. Publish and Invite
1. Edit survey in admin panel
2. Set publish dates and status
3. Send invitations via `/surveys/admin/{id}/invites/`
4. Share invite links with participants

## Question Types

| Type | Description | Anonymity Options |

## Anonymity Modes Explained

### üîí **ANONYMOUS**
- Never stores `identity_user`
- Perfect for sensitive topics
- No follow-up possible
- Highest privacy protection

### üîê **ESCROW** (Default)
- Stores `identity_user` but hides in reports
- Optional follow-up opt-in
- Contact method collection
- Balanced privacy and accountability

### ‚úçÔ∏è **SIGNED**
- Stores `identity_user` and shows in reports
- Default `is_signed=True`
- For commitments and goals
- Full accountability

## K-Anonymity Protection

The app enforces k-anonymity for cohort-based reports:
- Minimum cohort size threshold (default: 5)
- Aggregated data only when threshold met
- Raw text hidden for small cohorts
- Signed answers bypass k-protection for that item only

## Permission Levels

| Role | Capabilities |
|------|--------------|
| **Owner** | Full control, delete surveys |
| **Admin** | Edit surveys, manage invites, view reports |
| **Creator** | Create and edit surveys |
| **Analyst** | View aggregated reports only |
| **Viewer** | View published surveys only |

## API Endpoints

- `GET /surveys/api/{id}/` - Survey details for mobile/JS
- `POST /surveys/admin/{id}/reorder-sections/` - HTMX reordering
- `POST /surveys/admin/{id}/reorder-questions/` - HTMX reordering

## Management Commands

```bash
# Seed the Balanced Honesty template survey
python manage.py seed_balanced_honesty

# Create sample data (future)
python manage.py create_sample_surveys

# Clean up test data (future)
python manage.py cleanup_test_data
```

## Template Survey: "Balanced Honesty"

The seeded template includes:

1. **Trust & Safety** (Escrow) - Workplace safety and trust
2. **Workload & Clarity** (Escrow) - Role clarity and work-life balance  
3. **Commitments** (Signed) - Goals and accountability
4. **eNPS & Open Floor** (Anonymous) - Overall satisfaction

## Customization

1. Extend `Question.QUESTION_TYPES` in models.py
2. Add form handling in `AnswerForm._build_fields()`
3. Update templates to render new types
4. Add validation in `QuestionForm.clean()`

### Custom Anonymity Modes
1. Extend `Question.ANONYMITY_MODES` in models.py
2. Update form logic in `AnswerForm._build_fields()`
